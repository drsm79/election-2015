# election-2015
Some data analysis on the 2015 election result

## The data

I used this [file from the electoral commission][1].

## Install

    pipfile install


## The script

    pipfile shell
    python election.py -- --help
    python election.py

Returns something like:

    Counter({'total': 650, 'stay home win': 340, '<=10 pc of home win': 56, 'close call (500)': 13, 'close call (250)': 6, 'close call (100)': 3, 'close call (50)': 2})

Run `python election.py --show-win-over` to get more detail on what fraction of stay at home vote would be needed to change the result. Combine with `grep` to see things like [Conservative seats to target "stay at home" voters](targets.html).

Run `python election.py --show-stay-home` to see seats where the stay at home vote was larger than the winning candidate.

Run `python election.py --show-close` to see information about seats that were narrowly won.
